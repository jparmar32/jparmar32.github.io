   I am a Mathematics and Computer Science student at <span style="background-color:#bfd4f5;"><a href=https://www.stanford.edu>Stanford</a></span> where 
   I concentrate my studies within probability and machine learning. I'm fortuante to be advised by <span style="background-color:#4674bd;"><a href=http://statweb.stanford.edu/~adembo/>Amir Dembo</a></span>
   for my undergraduate degree. At Stanford i've spent my time exploring a variety of areas but with each my goal has been to learn how to levarage my understanding of 
   random phenomena and artificial intelligience to develop exciting ideas and products that will revolutionize our world. I believe that these two concepts 
   can not only guide us to a deeper understanding of the problems that challenge our lives but also give way to robust, innovative solutions.

  <h6>Currently, i'm:</h6>
  <p>
    Since March 2020 I've been working as a Machine Learning Engineer for <span style="background-color:#506587;"><a href=https://www.occamzrazor.com/work>OccamzRazor</a></span>.
    OccamzRazor is developing a biomedical knoweldge graph which aims to advance understanding of <span style="background-color:#d1f1ff;"><a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/drug-efficacy>drug efficacy</a></span> and provide novel treatments for diseases.
    My main focus of work has been on expanding out their natural langauge processing pipeline by researching and engineering new architectures for biomedical <span style="background-color:#4674bd;"><a href=https://medium.com/@venali/tutorial-series-on-nlp-information-extraction-tasks-99cd8309e2ef>information extraction</a></span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Researching in <span style="background-color:#4674bd;"><a href=https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/>Chris Re's</a></span> Lab at Stanford
    where I work with <span style="background-color:#506587;"><a href=https://web.stanford.edu/~ksaab/>Khaled Saab</a></span>. We are working on making use of passively observed human signals, such as one's 
    gaze, to learn better representations of tasks and help train better deep learning models. 
  </p>


  <p>
   Trying to mitigate the spread of <span style="background-color:#bfd4f5;"><a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/12/10/word-year-misinformation-heres-why/>misinformation</a></span> by developing a chrome extension to inform users on the validity of a news article. By doing so, I hope to to 
   fundementally change how we consume information in the age of social networks.
  </p>
    
    
  <h6>In the past, i've:</h6>
  <p>
    Researched with <span style="background-color:#506587;"><a href=https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~doty/>David Doty</a></span> at UC Davis where we built a domain specific language that allowed researchers to implement complex theoretical models in the field of 
    <span style="background-color:#d1f1ff;"><a href=<span style="background-color:#506587;"><a href=https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~doty/>David Doty</a></span>>algorithmic self assembly</a></span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Worked with <span style="background-color:#bfd4f5;"><a href=https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/person/faculty/david-chin>David Chin</a></span> at UMass Amherst where we investigated the intersection of 
    quantum and classical machine learning. In particuar, we looked to see whether quantum models could help us better assess the quality of care provided by hospitals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implemented architectures described in various machine learning research papers from scratch in <span style="background-color:#4674bd;"><a href=https://pytorch.org>PyTorch</a></span>.
    I wanted to dive deeper into the content I was learning in my
    classes and found that the best way to do so was to get hands on experience with the intracies of each model. Some of my favorite architectures that I implemented 
    were <span style="background-color:#506587;"><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385.pdf>ResNet</a></span> and a
    <span style="background-color:#d1f1ff;"><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf>Neural Image Caption Generation Model</a></span>. 
  </p>


  <h6>Outside of Work I enjoy: </h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Playing Chess. The <span style="background-color:#bfd4f5;"><a href=https://www.thechesswebsite.com/italian-game/>Italian Game</a></span> is my favorite opening.</li>
    <li>Cooking new dishes. <span style="background-color:#4674bd;"><a href=https://www.themediterraneandish.com/greek-chicken-souvlaki-recipe-tzatziki/>Souvlaki</a></span> has been my most recent hit recipe.</li>
    <li>Attending Concerts and Music Festivals. <span style="background-color:#506587;"><a href=https://www.rollingloud.com>Rolling Loud</a></span> was paricularly memorable.</li>
    <li>Hiking and Running. This <span style="background-color:#28aade;"><a href=https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mt-tallac-trail>trail</a></span> in Lake Tahoe offers some amazing views.</li>
    <li>Deep diving into philosophy. <span style="background-color:#d1f1ff;"><a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/>Socrates</a></span> holds a special place in my heart. </li>
    <li>Reading. <span style="background-color:#4965b3;"><a href=https://justmercy.eji.org>Just Mercy</a></span> has been an especially eye-opening book that i've just read.</li>
