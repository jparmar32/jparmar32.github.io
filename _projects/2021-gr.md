**Overview:** 
The climate of our society today is heavily dependent upon the massive amounts of information that is spread around. These articles, facebook posts, and tweets not only help inform users but also have severe consequences on social, economic, and political movements. Thus, it would be reasonable to expect that this information would be highly accurate and controlled for quality; however, this is hardly the case as there are rampant amounts of false information spread on a daily basis. This misinformation is then quickly propagated causing actions which have worldwide consequences to be taken off of incorrect bases. Itâ€™s imperative that we learn how to identify such false pieces and prevent their spread before they begin to have negative impacts.

To solve this issue, I am devolping Acta. Acta seeks to mitigate the spread of misinformation by using natural language processing(NLP) to identify false pieces and alert the user that the article or post they are looking at contains incorrect facts. Acta accomplishes this task through two parts. Part one is a chrome extension that supplies users with key credibility information for an article they are looking at. Such credibility information consists of lateral reading resources, the prevelance of biases in the piece, and the trustworthiness of the author and publishing site. By analyzing this information a user can ascertain a validity rating for the piece or post themselves which they can then register within the chrome extension. We then use the user's rating for the piece alongside other ratings to develop a crowdsourced validity rating for the article allowing us to collect a constantly growing false news dataset. 

This dataset then powers the second part of Acta which is a novel NLP architecture that identifies false articles and posts. Using our crowdsourced ratings alongside the features of an article users said were most helpful in identifying the validity of the piece we are able to train a classifier that is able to identify misinformation. As there is limited supervised data for this task, the dataset we are collecting will allow our model to not only achieve better performance metrics but also contain greater generalizability as we collect ratings for new articles as soon as they come out. This ML model is then avaiable through an API call to identifiy false pieces of information.
